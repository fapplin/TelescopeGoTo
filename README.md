# TelescopeGoTo
This is the source code to a telescope program I developed in Free Pascal/Lazarus many years ago. This project will not be supported by me in any way. The code is here for anyone that may want to take and do something with it.

The code and all files associated with the program can be found in 2 zip files (2 versions of the same program). The files can be downloaded from here.
